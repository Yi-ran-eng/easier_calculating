__A better way to do some math funtions' visualization__

these codes includes one main file called easierMath which provides direct way to complement some visualization. the other code named finidef is here to provide some algorithms including finite difference method,Runge-Kutta method,Euler method and so on.These can be found in other libraries like scipy also. so in our main file ,i usually use functions that are stored in scipy library. but for some particular algorithms you need to create it all by yourself, then these algorithms will be imported from files like finidef and ...
